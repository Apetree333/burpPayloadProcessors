# burpPayloadProcessors
Generate 
payload processors 
on the
fly - without 
having to
create individual 
extensions.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Name: Adhoc-Payload
Processing
           Description:
Creates a new
suite tab 
“Adhoc-Payload
Processing” 
that allows 
users to quickly 
define new payload processors with a single 
ruby function
with a     signature
  similar to
  the Burp 
  Extension API 
  using Ruby strings.
  All the boiler plate of registering
  extensions is 
  handled automatically. The tool allows for creating, removing,
  and saving your payload processors within 
          Burp suite.
Once the
function body 
is defined simply click “Create Payload
Processor” to make it immediately
available
in Intruder
Processors
can be similarly removed with the
“Remove Processor”
button and a 
fresh processor 
template
is always
available 
clicking “Restore
Template.”
Finally,
the currently
defined
payload
processors can be
saved using the 
“Save Extension
State” button;
this will 
preserve
payload processors 
across  restarts
of the suite
